# Shiny-App

The app shows the BUI, DC and DSR plots both station wise and region wise. It depends on the userâ€™s point of view. If they want to see the plot for a particular station, they can select the station wise plots tab, or if the user wants to view all the stations plot of a particular region, they can select the region of interest from the dropdown. For station wise plot, the user can select the year of interest, fire index and the station name. There are several stations to select from the dropdown. And for region wise plot, the user selects the region of interest from the list of regions and the other inputs remain the same.
